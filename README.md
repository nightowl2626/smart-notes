Welcome to Smart Notes! This is a very scrappy draft that was made in about a day. Updates will follow!

### Features

#### 📌 Take Notes On-the-Go
See something, say something, write something. Slap a sticky note on any webpage to capture your thoughts in the moment.

#### 🗂️ Categorize Your Chaos
Use hashtags (`#project`, `#todo`, etc.) to automatically organize your scattered thoughts into neat, clickable folders in the extension popup.

#### ✨ Backslash for AI
Feeling lazy? Type `/` followed by a command (e.g., `/summarize this page`) and press Enter. Let our AI assistant do the reading for you.

#### ☁️ Fetch From Anywhere
All your notes, perfectly organized by tag and color-coded, are waiting for you in the extension popup. No need to hunt them down.
